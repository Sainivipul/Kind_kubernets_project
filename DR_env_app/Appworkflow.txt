# crate one name space 
[ kubectl create na nginx ] we will create complete arc in this namewspace 
[ kubectl run nginx --image=nginx -n nginx ] same like a container it will create a nginx pod
[ kubectl get pods -n nginx ]

we can create and manage pods by command line but its not ideal lets make a new manifest file 

after creating namewspacel.yml

[kubectl apply -f name namespace.yml]

[ kubectl apply -f pod.yml ]

# how to enter nginx pod 

[ kubectl exec -it nginx-pod -n nginx -- bash ]

[ kubectl delete -f pod.yml ] because deployment file will create a pod also 


currently we are running on two pods now if we want to 
scale on high traffic 

kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment -n nginx --replica=5 

kubectl get pods 
kubectl get pods -n nginx -o wide
NOTE: rolling update 
we can chnage the running image of nginex 

kubectl set image deploymnet/nginx-deployment -n nginx nginx=nginx:1.27.3 
NOTE while this container was running or throwing error still that container was running not all pids will be down 
thats the main function of pods

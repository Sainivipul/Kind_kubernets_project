kubernets cluster can be made by 
kubeadm : heavy need one or more atlead t2 medium

Kind cluster(kubernmets in docker ) :cluster is a tool for running Kubernetes clusters locally, using Docker containers as nodes. It's designed primarily for testing and development purposes, 

EKS/AKS/GKE: on cloud 
# basic ec2 setup 

EC2: requirement --> t2 medium / storage 30gb

# Step :1 

copy installation script from kind_cluster folder and paste in a file in ec2 and run 
give executable permission 

# Step 2: install docker 
sudo apt update -y 
sudo apt-get install docker.io 
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker 
docker ps 
kubectl version 
kind --version
docker --version

## config file 
step 3 : setup 3 worker node and one master node cluster 
this config file will be a yaml file 

kind: Cluster
apiversion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4

nodes:
- role: control-plane 
  image: Kindest/node:v1.31.2 # no need to remember can be checkd by documnetation
- role: worker 
  image: Kindest/node:v1.31.2 # no need to remember can be checkd by documnetation
- role: worker 
  image: Kindest/node:v1.31.2 # no need to remember can be checkd by documnetation
- role: worker 
  image: Kindest/node:v1.31.2 # no need to remember can be checkd by documnetation
  extraPortMappings: 
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPortPort: 443
    protocol: TCP

# step4: create cluster 
kind create cluster --name=mycluster --config=config.yml

#NOTE once cluster is running we can interact with cluter using kubectl 
# any node where kubeadm is initialized is master node 

""" now lets understand how this architecture work 
NAMESPACE[(group){ ({[docker]POD}deployment)Service}]"
